# mm5sound

This repository is an attempt to translate an ancient 6502 assembly sound driver from Mega Man 5 into modern C++, so that I could use this to teach people a thing or two. Will it succeed!?

The source code does not have to be capable of producing / compiling data in the original form at all, but ROM addresses will be placed near relevant constructs for reference. **This cannot be used to compile music for Mega Man 5**, use [MGCInts](http://github.com/HertzDevil/MGCInts) instead (once I extend the `mm3` engine support).

### Testing

Assuming `Megaman V (U) [!].nes` is available as `mm5.nes` in the same directory, this produces a register write log which can be directly diffed against log files generated by NSFPlay:

```
$ make
$ ./mm5test > output.log
```

ROM images will no longer be required once there is a music data representation within C++.

### Roadmap

- [x] Finish all code (manually)
- [ ] Verify all music and sound effects are correct
- [ ] Music data classes (best make them entirely `constexpr` for extra challenge)
- [ ] Auxiliary classes that make it look more like "good" C++ ~~and less like FamiTracker~~
- [ ] Remove the NES memory model
- [ ] Add documentation and pictures
- [ ] Fully annotated disassembly
